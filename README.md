### Description

This repository describes using a periodic task with Celery 4.x and
Django 11.x in Openshift 3.4.  The task is irrelevant.
More importantly, getting a Celery container working with Openshift is
the focus of this repository.  The task in fact is to collect the Build Configs
each day for later querying.  This task could be refined, but this is an
attempt ot demonstrate Celery working in an Openshift environment.
